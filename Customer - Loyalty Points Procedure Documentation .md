## **Customer Summary & Loyalty Engine Stored Procedure**

This project implements an automated backend process for generating customer order summaries and awarding loyalty points in an e-commerce environment. It is designed for a fictional online store called *GlowCart*, which specializes in skincare and beauty products. The primary goal of this stored procedure, named `Customer_summary`, is to streamline the process of calculating total order value and determining loyalty points earned by customers for each completed purchase. This helps the company maintain accurate transaction records, enhance customer engagement through rewards, and optimize backend operations by reducing manual workload.

When a new order is placed, the procedure takes the order ID as input and performs several automated steps. First, it retrieves the corresponding customer ID from the `orders` table. It then calculates the total value of the order by summing the product of quantity and unit price for all items in the order, using data from the `order_items` table. Based on the total amount, loyalty points are computed using a simple rule: the customer earns 1 point for every \$20 spent. These computed values—total order amount and loyalty points—are returned via output parameters. Finally, the procedure logs the transaction into an internal `order_summary_log` table, which captures the order ID, customer ID, order total, points awarded, and the timestamp of the transaction.

This stored procedure improves real-world e-commerce operations by enabling real-time calculation of purchase value and rewards, thereby enhancing customer experience and encouraging repeat purchases. Additionally, the log table ensures traceability for financial audits and supports future analytics use cases like customer segmentation and retention modeling. From a business perspective, such an automated loyalty engine aligns with modern retail strategies that prioritize personalization, data-driven rewards, and operational efficiency. This procedure lays the groundwork for more advanced loyalty systems that could include customer tiers, seasonal bonuses, and behavioral targeting in future iterations.
